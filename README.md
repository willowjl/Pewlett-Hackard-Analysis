#Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

#Overview of the analysis:
###Pewlett-Hackard analysis is to prepare for an upcoming tsunami in a company with a few thousands employees. Many of the employees are planning to retire soon and the company would like to start looking ahead and planning the retiring packages and identify other resources to remain sustainable. The task started by creating a couple tables to determine the number of retiring employees, and the another to to identify employees to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results:
#### * During the analysis, it was determined that the majority of those retiring were Sr Engineers and Sr Staff Accounting.
#### * In order to continue operation smoothly in foreseable future, the company will have to prioritize replacing the roles with the most employees that will be impacted by the silver tsunami. 
#### * There are more people retiring than mentors available to coach the younger employees.
#### * Senior Engineers accounted for more 1/3 of the total retirees.

## Summary:
### The number of roles that will need to be filled depends on how many employees are willing to postpone their retirement to support the organization. Some department may be more important to the overall operation of an organization. The leadership will have to make that determination based on their need and expected outcomes. Using a few SQL query, we were able to determine that the top 3 departments thag would be impacted the most are Development, Production, and Sales with a total of 13,505 employees.
